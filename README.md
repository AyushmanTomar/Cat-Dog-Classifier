# üêæ Cat-Dog Classification using CNN üêæ

Welcome to the Cat-Dog Classification project! This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## Overview

In this project, we have developed a deep learning model using CNN architecture to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. This repository provides the model code, training scripts, and a detailed explanation of the process.

## Features

- *CNN Architecture*: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.
- *High Accuracy*: Achieves impressive accuracy in distinguishing between cats and dogs.
- *Easy to Use*: Simple scripts to train the model and make predictions.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-dog-classification.git
```
Run all the cells of cat-dog classification.ipynb
You can load your custom image in img_cat/img_dog variable to test the model with random images
